# Meta II

This is an implementation of Meta II in javascript (for pedagogical purposes).

The original paper is Meta-II-shore.pdf.

The original implementation of "Meta" in "Meta" is in `meta.meta`.  This targets a VM, implemented in `meta.js`. 

The `js.meta` file is an implementation of the meta grammar in meta targeting a stand-alone javascript file. This can be compiled with the original meta compiler or with itself, producing the same output.
